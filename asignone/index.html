            The first season of Harry Potter is based off of the first book in the series,
             the Philosopher's Stone. It is the first entry in the series and shortest of 
             the seasons. The show went into development in 1998 at Warner Brothers, and 
             was brought to life by HBO, and was by far their biggest show to be made until
              the 2010s when a show brought to life by a man who was very much involved with
               this one rose to prominence in A Song of Ice and Fire by Jack Zimmerman, who 
               plays Harry Potter himself. The season blew up with fans of the books and shattered 
               records and brought serious change to TV, proving undeniably that streaming services 
               were the future.

            Everyone came into the Wizarding World through the Harry Potter books
             and movies, which introduced us to a gifted 11-year-old, his friends 
             Ron and Hermione, and their hallowed school of magic, Hogwarts. Watching
              the Harry Potter movies in order, seeing the story unfold chronologically
               in-universe, used to be as easy as finding the one where Daniel Radcliffe 
               looks youngest and starting from there.

            But the series has expanded now with the Fantastic Beasts movies, set
             some 70 years before The Sorcererâ€™s Stone. So to watch the Harry Potter 
             movies in order, your journey now begins with Fantastic Beasts and Where to 
             Find Them, set in 1926 and starring Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scarmander. Fantastic
              Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is set in 1927. The third Fantastic Beasts
               intends to release July 2022, with two more movies to close out the Scarmander
                and Grindelwald saga.

            Lupin appears, embracing Black as an old friend before revealing 
            himself to be a werewolf. Snape arrives to apprehend Black but is
             knocked out by Harry's Disarming spell. Lupin and Black reveal that 
             Scabbers is actually the Animagus form of Pettigrew, who betrayed Harry's 
             parents, faked his death and framed Black for his own crimes. Turning
              Pettigrew back into human form, the group head back to the castle, 
              intending to both expose Pettigrew as the true criminal and exonerate 
              Sirius, but the full moon causes Lupin to transform and Pettigrew escapes. 
              Black transforms into his animal form and fights off werewolf Lupin, who 
              seriously injures Black. Black manages to escape when a distant wolf cry
               distracts Lupin and sends him off. Harry finds Black, who are then both 
               attacked by Dementors until an unseen figure casts a powerful Patronus
                charm to ward them off. Harry falls unconscious, awakening in the 
                infirmary with Dumbledore and Hermione.which she was given to attend several
                 classes at once, to go three hours back in time.
